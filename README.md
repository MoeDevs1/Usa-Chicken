# UsaChicken Store Web Application

Welcome to the UsaChicken Store repository! Born from my admiration for my favorite chicken store in New Hampshire, this project goes beyond the confines of a regular digital platform. Serving as a heartfelt tribute, I have taken great care to replicate their entire menu, granting users an interactive culinary journey where they can effortlessly order meals, fine-tune their choices, accrue sign-up bonuses, and so much more.
